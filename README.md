# Python Undergrad DataStructures and Algo Implementations

Since people seem to care about this stuff, I've added implementations of
important undergrad algorithms in Python. I'm using [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures as a guide](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html) Open an issue if you'd like me to implement a specific one.

So far I have:

## Sorting

* MergeSort
* QuickSort 
    - Elegant but inefficient filter based solution
    - Efficient in memory solution (in progress, needs a fix)

## Trees

* Binary Search Tree
    - TreeNode Class
